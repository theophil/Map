== Bajaj Foundation Map

This is a dynamic Google Maps application that maps villages in Wardha, Maharashtra, India, in which the Bajaj Foundation has done work. Administrators (people who log in) can add, edit, and delete villages and activities. If an administrator wants to add a marker to the map, they must add a "Village-Activity" by pairing a village in the system with an activity in the system. Please contact me or Gale Bonker for the login information.
